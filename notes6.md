# Starting JavaScript

## Day 3 Class 2 notes

#### Javascript is a programming language that gives a website movement and interaction.

In order to creates variables you can use
* `let "variableNameHere"`
* `const "variableNameHere"`
* `var "variableNameHere"`

A string is a variable of words, sentences or letters. This is found and made with quotes.

A number is a variable for numbers.

A boolean is a variable to declare something either true or false. **OR** 0 and 1. *This can be 1 and 2 depending on what language you are writing in, so know that for JavaScript its 0 and 1 but it can change.**

When naming variables, its industry standard to use camelCase which is a method of naming variables which specify the first word being lowercase and every following word being capital but all grouped together. EX: thisIsAnExampleOf CamelCase.

You **cannot** start the name of a variable with a number, but **can** start it with an underscore or dollarsign ($). You can also use a number *AFTER* the first letter in a variable.

You can comment out code or put in information to explain why you made the code you did with `//` at the beginning of a line of code for a single line comment **OR** `/* "COMMENTS HERE" */` for multi-line comments. You should get in the habbit of leaving comments in your code so others looking at your code can understand it.

You can nullify the value of the next letter or number in code with `\`.
