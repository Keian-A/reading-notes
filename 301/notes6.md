JavaScript (JS) doesn't run inside the browsers when a page is loaded or interacted with. Instead, the creater of Node improved upon the V8 engine to create Node. Node is, in other words - "a JavaScript runtime."

Reading questiong:
1. What is node.js?

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
  - Chrome's V8 JS Engine essentially compiles code on a website / application and sends it to your computer to run
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
  - Something that is involved in the process, but not necessarily runs the program

## Notes on [pair programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  - Greater efficiency
  - Engaged collaberation
  - Learning from fellow students
  - Social skills
  - Job interview readiness
  - Work environment readiness
1. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  - In my experience, I find number 3, or "learning from fellow students" the most beneficial. Since everyone does have their own way of doing things, if I am struggling to understand one way, being able to see another way or even just have someone explain it a way that makes sense to them sometimes is the missing puzzle piece, of sorts.
1. How does pair programming work?
  - In pair programming, there is a driver, and a navigator. The driver is the one with the code on their computer making the physical changes. The navigator, on the other hand, is the person watching the driver and telling them where to go and what to write.
