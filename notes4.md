# HTML Website Structure

## Day 2 Class 2 notes

# Chapter 18 Notes: Demographics

#### Things to consider when constructing a website
- Age range of audience?
- Gender?
- Country of audience?
- Urban or rural?
- Income?
- Level of education?
- Marital or family status?
- Occupations?
- Work hours?
- Web usage?
- Device used to access web?

These things should be considered when reaching individuals. When reaching companies you should consider:
- Size of company or specific department?
- Position of people in company who visit website?
- Will visiors be using the site for themselves or others?
- Budget that people control who look at site?

All of these should be considered when reaching a demographic and constructing a website.

Construction of the site should be influenced by the content which the target demographic wishes to seek.

If subjects aren't familiure with you or your brand you might need a section to introduce yourself/motives/goals of site.

When you construct a site it can be useful to set a schedule to tell yourself when or how often to update it depending on how often aspect of the site change, like stock of an item, news or information on a bulletin board, etc.

A useful technique to construct a site could be [**cardsorting**](cardsorting.md). 

Another technique is [**wireframing**](wireframe.md).

Size, color and style can be used to grab the attention of someone using your site.

To group information with similarity, you can use proximity, closure, continuance, white space, color and borders.

Consistency with design shows a similar importance of meaning with the information.

# Chapter 17 Notes: HTML Layout

#### Previously, the most common way of creating groups on HTML, authors would use the `<div>` element. They would use *class* or *id* attributes to indicate the role of a div element.

You can do so by using `<div id="description">` with the description being labeled as page, header, nav, etc. The new HTML5 allows `<header>` or `<nav>` instead.

Elements of a webpage include:
- header
- footer
- nav
- article
- aside
- section
- hgroup
- figure
- figcaption
- div
and much [more](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp).
