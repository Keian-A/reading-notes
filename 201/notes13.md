#### Local storage can commonly contain key:value pair storage types. If you need more than this, it is possible to create, or "embed" your own "database, invent your own file format, or any number of other solutions." (Pilgrim)

Modern domains can store 5 Mb of data

The key:value storage system uses HTML5

`setItem()` and `getItem()` are used for this

You must pair these with `parseInt()` variants to specify the datatype you get back however

In webpage storage you store strings, not the original data sent.

Local storage is set up as an object

SQL is a database and an API
