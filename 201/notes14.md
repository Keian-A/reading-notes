## Notes on [transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/) article

#### `transform` is a property in CSS that allows the designer to change:
- Size of Elements
- Position
- Elements themselves

`transform` comes with two variants:
- 2d
- 3d

`transform`'s use is as:

``` css
div {
  transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

## Notes on [transitions](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/) article

Essentially this shows that you use the transform property followed by a specific amount in parenthesis.

2d transforms allow:
- 2d rotate
- 2d scale
- 2d translate
- 2d skew

`transforms` is another CSS property that allows the designer of the site to target a specific element and, when the user hovers, change the appearance (color).

`transition-property` will change with other transitional properties (a different element on the page).

Not all properties can be transitioned. Usually only properties with a defined "half way point" are allowed to be transitioned.
