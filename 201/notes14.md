## Notes on [transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/) article

#### `transform` is a property in CSS that allows the designer to change:
- Size of Elements
- Position
- Elements themselves

`transform` comes with two variants:
- 2d
- 3d

`transform`'s use is as:

``` css
div {
  transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

## Notes on [transitions](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/) article

Essentially this shows that you use the transform property followed by a specific amount in parenthesis.

2d transforms allow:
- 2d rotate
- 2d scale
- 2d translate
- 2d skew

`transforms` is another CSS property that allows the designer of the site to target a specific element and, when the user hovers, change the appearance (color).

`transition-property` will change with other transitional properties (a different element on the page).

Not all properties can be transitioned. Usually only properties with a defined "half way point" are allowed to be transitioned.

In Silicon Valley it is encouraged to work together since they are able to discover and innovate better solutions, faster

Better workers tend to rotate their dining companions, thus expanding their social networking

Apparently being social increases productivity. It doesn't matter with who, but the act of networking out to many different people increases productivity.

It is important and healthy for a team to develop "norms" to enable a more productive working method

Overall, the best thing you can do to have a healthy, strong team, is to allow everyone's input and value every member and what they contribute

Good managers need to listen to one another and "show sensitivity to feelings and needs."
