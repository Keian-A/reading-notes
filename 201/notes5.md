#### There are different options when choosing an option in coding a page in HTML.
You need to keep in mind:

It is common practice to save images in a folder so you don't have to call anywhere else but files stored in the server that is located with the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Changing the width of an image section in CSS can change how it appears on a webpage

You should keep in mind where images are wanted on the webpage to determine where in relation to other elements they get coded to

The three rules for creating images:
1. Save images in the right format (.jpeg, .gif, .png)
1. Save images at the right size
1. Measure images in pixels

## Notes on image extension article

#### .jpg or .jpeg images are compressed for the limits of human perception
- This means that jpg is good for images with smooth transitions but cause restrictments when there are sharper lines on the image

PNG is lossless using *DEFLATE compression* which means no data is lost during compression opposed to jpg, but this will give higher quality at the cost of higher storage space

GIF is a lossless image format that uses *LZW compression algorithm* which means that it was favored over PNG in graphical images in early day web development. It is common practice to use PNG now, and GIF is only used if the image contains animations.

PNG also allows for transparancy, along with GIF but jpg does not.
