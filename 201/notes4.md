## Chapter 4 notes from HTML

#### Links allow you to transverse from one webpage to another.

Types of links:
- Links from one website to another
- Links from one page to another on the same site
- Links that take you to a different part of the same webpage
- Links that open in a new browser window
- Links that start up your email and can start a new email to someone

Links in HTML are created with `<a href="">This is the text the user clicks on</a>` tags

`mailto:` is a way in HTML to enable a link when clicked to start an email address to a specific person.

You can use the id attribute to link to a specific area of the page you want a link to direct you to.

## Chapter 15 notes from HTML

#### Block level elements take up as much space as they can, opposed to inline elements.

If one element is within another, the outter one is called the *parent* element or the *containing* element.

Positioning schemes allow you to control the layout of a webpage. There is:
- Normal flow
  - This means that by default two elements will apear below eachother in descending order down the page, even if there is space next to one element for the next.
- Relative positioning
  - This moves an element up, down, left, or right, but all other elements stay in their own space.
- Absolute positioning
  - This is taken out of the normal flow meaning that it does not affect the position of any surroundingn elements. Absolute element positions move as users scroll up and down the page.
- Fixed positioning
  - This positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. These dont move as the user moves around the page.
- Floating elements
  - This moves an element to either the left or right of a block which other content can move around.

  It's best to keep elements within a max range of 960 to 1000 px wide.

## Chapter 3 review from JS

#### To organize code and condense what can be hundreds to thousands of lines of code, programmers use:
- Functions and methods
  - Functions are a series of lines of code condensed within a callable unit. A method is the same as a function, but they are created and are part of an object
- Objects
  - These consist of properties and methods
- Built-in objects
  - These exist as pre-built into the webpage as interactive toolkits.

At the end of a function there is commonly a return value which is sent back after function finishes.

## Notes from article: "6 Reasons for Pair Programming"

#### Pair programming involves two roles:
1. The driver
  - This is the person that has their hands on the keyboard writing the code, manages text editor, switching files, and version control as well.
1. The navigator
  - This is the person that tells the driver where to go and what comes next. They think about the big picture and how an algorithm could be converted into code.

Pair programming engages multiple areas of learning as long as the two are switching back and forth. This also stimulates:
- greater efficiency
- engaged collaboration
- learning from other fellow students
- social skills
- job interview readiness
- and work environment readiness
