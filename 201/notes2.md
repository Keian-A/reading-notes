## Chapter 2 notes from HTML

#### Markup refers to the tags you add you a webpage which provide extra meaning and sets the structure of the page.

- Structural markup: These make edits to headings and paragraphs
- Semantic markup: Adds extra information, such as emphasis on a sentence.

HTML tags include:
- `<h1>` through `<h6>` refers to the header tag, the smaller the number, the larger the text size.
- `<p>` refers to the paragraph tag which houses text.
- `<b>` refers to the bold tag which makes text **bold**.
- `<i>` refers to the italics tag which *italicizes* text.
- `<sup>` refers to the superscript tag which superscripts text.
- `<sub>` refers to the subscript tag which subscripts text.
- `<br />` refers to the line break tag which inserts a line break.
- `<hr />` refers to the horizontal rules
- much more can be found online.

You should **always** write the styling separate from the HTML document, in a separate, but linked, CSS document.

## Chapter 10 notes from HTML book

#### CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is the coding language that allows you to add styling to tags and sections from your HTML document.

Each element written in HTML can be thought of as in an imaginary box and you can style that box's appearance with CSS.

CSS starts with `selector {` then, `property:` followed by `value; }`

## Chapter 2 notes from JS book

#### Javascript allows functionality within a webpage to evolve from a static page.

You should get in the habit of commenting on your own code in sections to not only describe your code for you to follow later, but also others looking at your code to follow along with what you've done and why.

Variables are created to allow the storage of information for a program to calculate information fed into it.

Variables should be written in Camel Case. This means the first word should be lower case but ever word following is caps locked and combined into one word. (EX: theQuickBrownFox)

An array will store a list of variables instead of a single one.

## Chapter 4 notes from JS book

#### Loops allow you to repeat a certain code section for none to many iterations based on a condition.

`For loops` allow a specific number of iterations to be ran.

`While loops` allow you to check a condition after each iteration to see if there will be another iteration or not.

`Do while loop` are identicle to while loops, with the exception that it will always be ran at least once, opposed to `while loops` which could be ran 0 times if the condition is false.
