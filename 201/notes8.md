## Chapter 15 review from HTML

#### Block level elements take up as much space as they can, opposed to inline elements.

If one element is within another, the outter one is called the *parent* element or the *containing* element.

Positioning schemes allow you to control the layout of a webpage. There is:
- Normal flow
  - This means that by default two elements will apear below eachother in descending order down the page, even if there is space next to one element for the next.
- Relative positioning
  - This moves an element up, down, left, or right, but all other elements stay in their own space.
- Absolute positioning
  - This is taken out of the normal flow meaning that it does not affect the position of any surroundingn elements. Absolute element positions move as users scroll up and down the page.
- Fixed positioning
  - This positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. These dont move as the user moves around the page.
- Floating elements
  - This moves an element to either the left or right of a block which other content can move around.

  It's best to keep elements within a max range of 960 to 1000 px wide.
