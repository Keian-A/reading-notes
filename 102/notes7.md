# Parts of a Computer

## Day 3 Class 2 notes

#### Programs that are run through languages with interpreters are sent line for line through the ram into the CPU to run each line at a time. This means that languages that use interpreters opposed to compilers, which translate all code to object code at once, will always run from top down.

Computers:
1. Input
    * These devices take input from the 'outside' world and convert it into binary information.
    * Keyboards
    * Microphones
    * Mice, etc.
1. Store
    * Long term information is stored on the Hard Drive.
    * Short term information, such as a currently running (or about to be current) program will be sent to RAM to be fed into the CPU.
1. Process
    * The CPU calculates information based on the lines of code fed to it through the RAM.
1. Output
    * Binary code is sent from the CPU to a screen or some other output device to get a response in the 'outside' world.
