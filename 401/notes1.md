## Notes on [how to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)
- The biggest mistake of a new programmer is learning the syntax instead of how to solve a problem
- When you encounter a new problem:
1. Understand what is being asked
2. Plan what you need to do
3. Divide into smaller problems or sections and complete each one
4. If stuck, step back and rethink plan or debug
5. Practice a ton of code problems prior

## Notes on [getting to the 5 whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)
- Start with the problem you have and keep asking "why" until you have discovered the root cause
- This is more beneficial if you are asking someone directly with the problem
