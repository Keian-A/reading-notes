## Responses to Read-11 questions

1. Why is access control important?
  - This is important so only select users with specific permissions can make changes/delete things that need to be deleted, and prevent others from deleting things that need to stay.
2. Describe an application that would need access control.
  - An application that needs access control could be a portfolio for a stock account, a parental figure could make trades, whereas a child could view the account to see the changes.
3. What is a role used for?
  - A role is used to restrict capabilities of a user so they may not make changes detrimental to the functionality of said application.
4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
  - By assigning a user at creation a role, this forces their whole experience on an application to be limited to constraits previously put forth in the design and construction of said application.

Define:

- Authorization
  - This refers to the access a user has to an application, this can either be true (they have access) or false (they aren't permitted into the application).
- Role Based Access Control
  - This refers to the contraints put on users during account creation so that they may only interact with the application in pre-determined ways.
- Capabilities
  - This refers to the constraints in general that allow or confine users to access on an application.

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  - Role-based Access Control
  - Authorization
  - Capabilities
Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  - Role-based Access Control
  - Authorization
  - Capabilities
What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
  - Role-based access control is interesting and sounds fun implementing a restriction-type method of access to an application.
