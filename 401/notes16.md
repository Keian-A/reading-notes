1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
  - This is the connection between a client and a server during an HTTP request / response.
2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
  - A server in this regard is the computer that GETS the request from the client, and SENDS the response back to the client.
3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
  - This means to bring it live, which means that if someone has the correct information available, they can use this "deployed" entity to interact with.

## Define: 

Server
  - This is the computer that is used to recieve a request of some sort and attempts to fullfil that request in a response.
Pub/Sub
  - This is the terminology when using web sockets instead of HTTP requests for real-time communication between client(s) and server(s). The entity that is sending out the connection is the publisher, whereas the entity that accepts the connection is the subscriber.
WRRC
  - This is the cycle between a client and a server using HTTP requests. A request is always sent out by the client, this is picked up on the server. Usually data is sent back to the client from the server on the response. This ends the cycle. WRRC stands for Web Request Response Cycle.
