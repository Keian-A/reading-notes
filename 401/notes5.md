## Notes on Test Driven Development

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  - Enables the user to see what the server is sending out
  - Enables the server developers to test their routes / functions to ensure correct usage
  - Prevents bugs
2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
  - You would need to use these if you are creating data for testing in a SQL database
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  - It takes time and deep understanding of *what* the code block getting tested does to accomplish
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
  - ES6 Classes consolidates data, where as Constructor/Prototype Classes are used to run specific code or create data
5. Why REST?
  - Why *not* rest? This question is open-ended and I am confused by it. If you are asking why *use* rest? Then, you would want to use this for relational database connections between two or more data structures

### Define: 

- functional programming: This is programming that takes advantage of functions, and uses them to shorten, abbreviate, and reuse code blocks.
- object-oriented programming (OOP): This is programming that takes advantage of using objects. This means that code is abbreviated to constructor functions and can be called with their properties / methods instead of creating a ton of variables or instances.
- class: This is an attribute in HTML to use in CSS to change a plethora of visual changes to a plethora of different elements. This is also a type of data consolidation method that can shorten or abbreviate like-items.
- `super`: This is a react constructor method that enables the use of the parent prop data in the child.
- `this`: `this` is a component specific keyword that identifies specific data within said component.
- Test Driven Development (TDD): This is the method of development that requires running tests for each functional component of the server constructed.
- Jest: Jest is a third party JavaScript testing framework, ["with a focus on simplicity."](https://jestjs.io/)
- Continuous Integration (CI): This is the process of automating the integration of code from different contributors and compiling it.
- REST: Representational State Transfer, this is more of a methodology that people use to relate like-data.
- Data Model: This is the process of modeling out how your data structures stored in your databases will look like, and what they will store.

- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  - `super`
  - `this`
  - `object-oriented programming`
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  - Jest
  - Continuous Integration
  - ReST
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
  - Object-oriented programming
