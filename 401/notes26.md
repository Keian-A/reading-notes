## Notes for class 26

- Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
  1. Angular
    - Cross-platform
    - Creates SPAs (single page application)
    - Turns templates into code that is "highly optimized for JavaScript virtual machines"
  2. Vue.js
    - Used for simple applications in a short time
    - Uses a feature "data binding" to assign values to HTML attributes and add classes for ease of rendering
  3. Ember.js
    - This provides two way data binding, in turn providing a system for complex user interfaces
  4. Meteor
    - This is used for full-stack applications
    - Provides built-in: automatic CSS, reactive templates, helpers, and events
  5. Mithril
    - Similar to React, provides basic client-side framework
    - Creates SPAs
- List taken from [here](https://hackr.io/blog/best-javascript-frameworks)
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
  - Framework:
    - A foundation of code and workflow
  - Library:
    - A bunch of code you download. You make your own workflow.
