1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
  - React uses JSX which is an interaction of the three languages in a logic-based structure. 
2. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?
  - A function component runs the actual code block that exists in the memory, whereas class based components create an instance of the code that exists, or a reference to it.

## Define
- Functional Components
  - These are components structured with functions, which means that on rendering, the page uses the actual code block to create the render, instead of an instance created that would happen with a class-based component.
- Children / Child Components
  - These are components that are rendered based on the parent component, or the component the child component is imported into and used.
