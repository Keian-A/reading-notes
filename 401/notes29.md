## Ethics in Tech

[Notes from this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-employees-protest-contract-us-army-hololens-2019-2)

This article brings up the idea that employees for a company should have a say for what their work is contributing towards. In the specific example the article brings up, Microsoft employees are upset that their work is contributing toward "war profiteering." This essentially means that Microsoft signed a deal with the DoD to create an augmented lens for military use. A lot of workers were uncomfortable with the end goal that their work was being contributed towards, rightfully so, since shouldn't a employee have a say in what their work is contributing towards? It is much harder to do this the larger the company in question is, since there is a lot more people between a worker (such as an entry-level programmer) and the CEO.

This article brings into light, the ethics behind self-driving cars. There are way too many small permutations and factors that go into even a "simple trip to the corner store." Trying to program every possibility into an AI so a devastating tragic accident doesn't occur every time a dog decides to jaywalk. In the case of that example alone, the vehicle would need to question the speed of the car, possible obstacles available to go around the dog, odds the dog randomly picks up speed or backtracks into a previous lane, or worst case scenario, if the entity's life that is jaywalking is more important than the person in the car, if so should the car crash to avoid the obstacle? Or should it run through the obstacle. There is so much calculations a self driving vehicle needs to be aware of all the time. The question is, does the programmer (the person shaping the decisions of the AI) have the right to ethically determine which obstacle, or choice the vehicle in question makes, the morally correct choice.
