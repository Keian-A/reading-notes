# Notes on the Markdown language

## Day 1 Class 1 notes

### The number of #'s before a line of text will determine the `<h1>` to `<h6>` depending on how many are used in respect to the count or number of #'s.

There are multiple ways of typing out bold or italicized, for example `*italicized*` and `_italicized_`. There is also `**BOLD**` and `__BOLD__`.

You can create a link to an external website using `[website name / here / this website / etc.](http://www.WEBSITE-NAME.com)`.

Example: [This](http://www.google.com) link will send you to Google.

~#Do not forget to put a space after the #'s at the beginning of a line~

To implement a list of bullet points use `*` at the beginning of a line and to number them use `1.` at the beginning of every line.

You can comment out code in the middle of a line in a sense by using \` or \\ so you can type code as a comment without actually using the code as a means to change something.
