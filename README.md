# These are my reading notes for CodeFellows.

#### Growth mindset to me is the methodology that all mistakes and failures can be learned from to become a better person in the field which the mistake was made.
#### Three reminders to keep a healthy growth mindset could be to set an alarm to stay on a schedule of coding specific days or times of the week, get engaged in a community where people share or talk about their code ideas or projects, and continuing to work on assignments or past code to refine and make more efficent.

### The number of #'s before a line of text will determine the `<h1>` to `<h6>` depending on how many are used in respect to the count or numbner of #'s.
### There are multiple ways of typing out bold or italicized, for example `*italicized*` and `_italicized_`. There is also `**BOLD**` and `__BOLD__`.
### You can create a link to an external website using `[website name / here / this website / etc.](http://www.WEBSITE-NAME.com)`.
### Example: [This](http://www.google.com) link will send you to Google.
### ~#Do not forget to put a space after the #'s at the beginning of a line~
### To impliment a list of bullet points use `*` at the beginning of a line and to number them use `1.` at the beginning of every line.
### You can comment out code in the middle of a line in a sense by using \` or \\ so you can type code as a comment without actually using the code as a means to change something.

- [ ] Learning everything there is to know about Markdown. (yes this is probably unfeasible)
