# These are my reading notes for CodeFellows.

### The number of #'s before a line of text will determine the `<h1>` to `<h6>` depending on how many are used in respect to the count or numbner of #'s.
### There are multiple ways of typing out bold or italicized, for example `*italicized*` and `_italicized_`. There is also `**BOLD**` and `__BOLD__`.
